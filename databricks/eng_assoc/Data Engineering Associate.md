- Delta Lake is a cluster and storage of files and their logs
- log is source of truth
- writes create a copy of the parquet and a copy of the log with the new changes in each. reads always check the log first and get latest data. it's atomic so if a part of the write fails, it will not be recorded in the log and the new file will be discarded.
